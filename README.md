# discord.py-image-search-bot
This is some code for a bot made for discord in python. You must setup the bot first through the discord developer portal.
First of all, you need to generate a custom google browser code. you can find it over here: https://programmablesearchengine.google.com/ (dont forget to turn on image search)
Then the google custom search api, which you can find here: https://console.cloud.google.com/
You have to type !show before any word, so it can search google and show you the image. For example: you type: !show duck and it'll show you a duck.
the command !show test doesn't work, it just gives you an error.
